# Dailies

![January](../assets/images/posts/2022-01-dailies/2022-01-dailies.png)

I decided to make a goal to do at least some kind of art everyday for the month of January. It was valuable to get more routines and patterns going.  I ended up in Procreate more in the beginning of the month, but gravitated to Infinite Painter and Clip Studio paint more as the month went on. Infinite Painter just seems to match me better than Procreate and feels less babyish lol. Clip Studio brush feel just can't be beat, pure pleasure painting in it.

I did end up using Nomad Sculpt for several of the days and it's an amazing piece of software too.

My takeaway is that even though I didn't spend a huge amount of time on each of these daily pieces, just the act of finding something inspiring to paint or sculpt and then the process of getting down to it was very worth it and enjoyable.
